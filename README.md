## 📖 Usage Guide

### Step 1: Data Upload
1. Access the dashboard via the live link or local setup
2. Use the file uploader to select your hospital CSV data
3. Ensure your CSV contains columns: `Department`, `Quarter`, `Year`, `Patient_Count`

### Step 2: Department Selection
1. Use the multi-select dropdown to choose specific departments
2. Select "All Departments" for hospital-wide analysis
3. Apply filters to focus on specific time periods

### Step 3: Generate Insights
1. **Bar Chart Analysis**: View patient distribution across selected departments
2. **Trend Analysis**: Observe patient flow patterns over time
3. **Quarterly Breakdown**: Analyze seasonal variations in patient influx

### Step 4: Export Results
1. Download filtered datasets using the export functionality
2. Save generated visualizations for presentations
3. Generate reports for administrative meetings

## 🔍 Data Processing Approach

### Data Cleaning Pipeline
```python
def clean_hospital_data(df):
    # Remove null values and duplicates
    # Standardize department names
    # Validate date ranges
    # Handle missing patient counts
    # Convert data types for analysis
```

### Key Processing Steps
1. **Schema Validation**: Verify required columns exist
2. **Data Type Conversion**: Ensure numerical fields are properly formatted
3. **Duplicate Removal**: Eliminate redundant records
4. **Missing Value Handling**: Implement strategies for incomplete data
5. **Department Standardization**: Normalize department naming conventions
